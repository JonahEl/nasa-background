# nasa-background
A Kotlin console app to fetch the latest image from NASA's Earth imaging camera (https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/) aboard the DISCOVR satellite (https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/dscovr-deep-space-climate-observatory/).

Makes completely overkill usage of Vertx (https://vertx.io) and Kotlin's coroutines because I want to play with them.   

**Note: This is play code not professional. So there is minimal documentation and no tests**
